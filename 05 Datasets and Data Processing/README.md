- Using Datasets’ Map Function for Preprocessing
- Visualizing Pipeline Performance

## 💡 Why Master Datasets and Data Processing?

Efficient data handling is critical for AI success:
1. **Scalability**: Process large datasets with minimal overhead.
2. **Flexibility**: Support diverse data formats and tasks.
3. **Performance**: Optimize pipelines for faster training.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in AI/ML data engineering challenges.

## 📆 Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1: Exploring Hugging Face Datasets Library
  - Day 2: Loading and Preprocessing Datasets
