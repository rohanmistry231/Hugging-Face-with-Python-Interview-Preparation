## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Performance Visualization with Hugging Face Roadmap**! üìä This roadmap is designed to teach you how to measure and visualize the performance of Hugging Face models. It covers measuring accuracy, latency, and resource usage, visualizing metrics like confusion matrices and latency plots, comparing pre-trained vs. fine-tuned models, and analyzing scalability under load. Aligned with the tech-driven era (May 3, 2025), this roadmap equips you with practical skills for evaluating and optimizing AI models, as well as interview preparation for 6 LPA+ roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Measuring Model Accuracy, Latency, and Resource Usage**: Quantifying model performance metrics.
- **Visualizing Performance Metrics**: Creating plots like confusion matrices and latency graphs.
- **Comparing Pre-trained vs. Fine-Tuned Models**: Analyzing performance differences.
- **Analyzing Scalability Under Load**: Evaluating model behavior under stress.
- **Hands-on Code**: Four Python scripts with practical examples and visualizations.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers for performance evaluation.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- AI/ML Engineers optimizing model performance.
- Data Scientists analyzing model metrics and scalability.
- Backend Developers integrating performance monitoring into AI systems.
- Anyone preparing for AI/ML or data science interviews.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This roadmap covers four key areas of performance visualization for Hugging Face models, each with a dedicated Python script:

### üìè Measuring Model Accuracy, Latency, and Resource Usage (`measure_performance.py`)
- Calculating Accuracy and F1 Score
- Measuring Inference Latency
- Simulating Resource Usage (e.g., Memory)
- Visualizing Performance Metrics

### üìà Visualizing Performance Metrics (`visualize_metrics.py`)
- Plotting Confusion Matrices
- Creating Latency and Accuracy Plots
- Visualizing Metric Distributions

### ‚öñÔ∏è Comparing Pre-trained vs. Fine-Tuned Models (`compare_models.py`)
- Evaluating Pre-trained and Fine-Tuned Model Performance
- Comparing Accuracy and Latency
- Visualizing Comparative Metrics

### üìâ Analyzing Scalability Under Load (`analyze_scalability.py`)
- Simulating High-Load Inference Scenarios
- Measuring Latency Under Stress
- Visualizing Scalability Trends

## üí° Why Master Performance Visualization?

Visualizing model performance is crucial for optimization:
1. **Insight**: Understand model strengths and weaknesses.
2. **Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in latency or resource usage.
3. **Comparison**: Evaluate improvements from fine-tuning.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in AI/ML performance analysis challenges.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1: Measuring Model Accuracy, Latency, and Resource Usage
  - Day 2: Visualizing Performance Metrics
  - Day 3: Comparing Pre-trained vs. Fine-Tuned Models
  - Day 4: Analyzing Scalability Under Load
  - Day 5-6: Review scripts and practice tasks
  - Day 7: Build a performance dashboard for a model

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv hf_env; source hf_env/bin/activate`.

   - Copy code from `.py` files into a Python environment.
   - Use VS Code, PyCharm, or Google Colab.
   - View outputs in terminal and Matplotlib/Seaborn visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.
4. **Datasets and Models**:
   - Uses synthetic data (e.g., mock predictions) and lightweight models (e.g., DistilBERT).
   - Note: Scripts simulate resource usage and scalability for compatibility.
