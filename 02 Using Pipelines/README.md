## üí° Why Master Hugging Face Pipelines?

Hugging Face pipelines are a game-changer for AI development:
1. **Simplicity**: Run complex models with minimal code.
2. **Versatility**: Support NLP, vision, audio, and multimodal tasks.
3. **Scalability**: Easily integrate into production systems.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Frequently tested in AI/ML coding challenges.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1: Introduction to Pipelines for Quick Inference
  - Day 2: Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, and Question Answering
  - Day 3: Vision and Audio Pipelines
  - Day 4: Handling Pipeline Parameters and Custom Models
  - Day 5-6: Review scripts and practice tasks
  - Day 7: Build a multi-task pipeline combining text, vision, or audio

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv hf_env; source hf_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install transformers datasets torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib pandas`.
   - Optional: Install `pillow` for image tasks or `librosa` for audio tasks.
2. **Hugging Face Account**:
   - Sign up at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) for Hub access (optional for custom models).
3. **Running Code**:
   - Copy code from `.py` files into a Python environment.
   - Use VS Code, PyCharm, or Google Colab.
   - View outputs in terminal and Matplotlib visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.
4. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic data (e.g., text, simulated images/audio) for compatibility.
   - Note: Scripts use lightweight models (e.g., DistilBERT, ViT-Base) to avoid heavy computation.
