- Navigating the Model Hub Programmatically
- Querying Models and Datasets
- Visualizing Hub Exploration Results

### üìù Understanding Model Cards and Community Contributions (`model_cards_contributions.py`)
- Analyzing Model Card Structure and Content
- Simulating Community Contributions (e.g., Model Upload)
- Visualizing Model Card Metadata

## üí° Why Master Hugging Face Basics?

Hugging Face is a cornerstone of modern AI development:
1. **Accessibility**: Simplifies access to pre-trained models and datasets.
2. **Community-Driven**: Thousands of models and datasets available on the Hub.
3. **Versatility**: Supports NLP, vision, audio, and multimodal tasks.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Frequently tested in AI/ML coding challenges.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1: Overview of Hugging Face Ecosystem
  - Day 2: Installing Transformers and Dependencies
  - Day 3: Exploring the Hugging Face Hub
  - Day 4: Understanding Model Cards and Community Contributions
  - Day 5-6: Review scripts and practice tasks
  - Day 7: Build a simple script combining all concepts (e.g., query Hub and test a model)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv hf_env; source hf_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install transformers datasets requests matplotlib pandas huggingface_hub`.
2. **Hugging Face Account**:
   - Sign up at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) for Hub access.
   - Optional: Generate an API token for programmatic Hub interactions.
3. **Running Code**:
   - Copy code from `.py` files into a Python environment.
   - Use VS Code, PyCharm, or Google Colab.
   - View outputs in terminal and Matplotlib visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.
4. **Datasets and Models**:
   - Uses synthetic data or small Hugging Face models (e.g., DistilBERT).
   - Note: Scripts are lightweight to avoid heavy computation.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Overview of Hugging Face Ecosystem**:
   - List key Hugging Face libraries and their purposes.
   - Visualize the ecosystem components (e.g., libraries, Hub).
2. **Installing Transformers and Dependencies**:
   - Set up a virtual environment and install Transformers.
   - Run a sample text classification task to verify installation.
3. **Exploring the Hugging Face Hub**:
   - Query the Hub for models with a specific task (e.g., text-classification).
   - Visualize the number of models per task.
4. **Understanding Model Cards and Community Contributions**:
   - Analyze a Model Card for a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT).
   - Simulate uploading a model to the Hub and visualize metadata.
