- Evaluating Model Performance (Accuracy, F1 Score)
- Saving and Loading Fine-Tuned Models
- Visualizing Evaluation Metrics

## üí° Why Master Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is critical for tailoring AI models:
1. **Customization**: Adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks.
2. **Performance**: Improve accuracy for domain-specific data.
3. **Efficiency**: Leverage pre-trained weights to reduce training time.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in AI/ML model optimization challenges.

## üìÜ Study Plan
