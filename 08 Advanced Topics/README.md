## üí° Why Master Advanced Topics?

Advanced Hugging Face skills unlock cutting-edge AI:
1. **Innovation**: Build multimodal and optimized models.
2. **Efficiency**: Reduce model size and inference time.
3. **Community**: Contribute to the global AI ecosystem.
4. **Ethics**: Ensure fair and responsible AI systems.
5. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in advanced AI/ML challenges.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1: Multimodal Models
  - Day 2: Model Optimization
  - Day 3: Community Contributions
  - Day 4: Ethical AI and Bias Mitigation
  - Day 5-6: Review scripts and practice tasks
  - Day 7: Build a multimodal model pipeline with bias analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv hf_env; source hf_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install transformers torch matplotlib pandas huggingface_hub optimum evaluate`.
2. **Hugging Face Account**:
   - Sign up at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) for Hub access (required for contributions).
